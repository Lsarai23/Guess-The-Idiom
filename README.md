# Guess-The-Idiom
Hey guys!🖐️

In this projects, you have a idiom guesser!

It returns if a piece of text given is in portuguese or in english, based on the usual frequency of each letter in each idiom,
based on <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequência_de_letras">here</a>.

I've used Python to create arrays of intergers to show a difference between similar frequencies, in order to be easier. For example, instead of comparing 14,58% and 14,34%, the first turns into 15% and the second, 14%.

I've applied knowledge of:
- Sort algorithms
- Reading files
- Basics from C (loops, conditionals,...)
- In Python: pandas

**I hope you enjoy it!🤟**
